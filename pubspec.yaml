# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/dialpad/
    - assets/icon.png
    - assets/branding.png
    - assets/static-bg.jpg
    - assets/dialpad/1.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/2.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/3.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/4.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/5.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/6.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/7.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/8.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/9.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/0.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/star.mp3
    - assets/dialpad/hash.mp3

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
